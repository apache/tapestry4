<p>  FormConditional is a variant of &Conditional; designed to be used in a &Form;, similar to the relationship between &Foreach; and &ListEdit;. It is used to guarantee that the data will be the same during rendering and rewind when a form is submitted avoiding a stale link.
On render, FormConditional reads condition parameter, stores it into a hidden field, and could render or not according to condition value. On rewind, the FormConditional ignores condition parameter, reads the stored value, and could render or not matching previous render.
</p>

      <warning>
          This component has been deprecated; Tapestry 4.0 adds the &If; component which
          allows conditionalized elements to be safely contained by &Form; components.
      </warning>
