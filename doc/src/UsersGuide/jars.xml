	<title>Tapestry JAR files</title>
	
<para>
The Tapestry distribution includes the Tapestry JARs, plus all the dependencies (other libraries that
Tapestry makes use of). The JAR files are in the <filename>lib</filename> folder (or in folders beneath it).
</para>
	
	
<variablelist>
		
	<varlistentry>
		<term>&TapestryFrameworkJar;</term>
		<listitem>
			<para>
			The main Tapestry framework.  This is needed at compile time and runtime.   The framework release number is
			integrated into the file name.
			</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>

		<term>&TapestryContribJar;</term>
		<listitem>
		<para>

		as the &Palette;.  Needed at runtime if any such components are used in an application.
		The framework release number is integrated into the file name.

		<term><filename>runtime/<replaceable>*</replaceable>.jar</filename></term>
		<listitem>
		<para>
		Frameworks that are usually needed at runtime (but not at framework build time) and

		is just the &Log4J; framework.

	<varlistentry>
		<term><filename>j2ee/*.jar</filename></term>
