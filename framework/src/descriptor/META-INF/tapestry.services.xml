<module id="tapestry.services" version="3.1.0">

  Contains the Tapestry engine services, and the configuration points for creating new
  ones (or overriding the factory defaults).

  <schema id="EngineServices">
    
    <element name="service">
      
      <attribute name="object" translator="object" required="true">
        
        Engine services are typically, but not definitively, HiveMind services (they
        can be simple objects as well). The name of each service is obtained
        from the service itself.

    </element>
    
  </schema>

  <configuration-point id="FactoryServices" schema-id="EngineServices">
    
    Configuration point for the factory default services. Each contributed service
    must have a unique name.
    
  </configuration-point>
  
  <contribution configuration-id="FactoryServices">
    
    <service object="instance:org.apache.tapestry.engine.HomeService"/>

  </contribution>
  
  <configuration-point id="ApplicationServices" schema-id="EngineServices">
    
    Configuration point for application services. Each contributed service must 
    have a unique name, but services contributed here will override services
    provided in the FactoryServices configuration point.
    
  </configuration-point>
  
  <service-point id="ServiceMap" interface="org.apache.tapestry.services.ServiceMap">
    
    Used to locate a service by name, using the FactoryServices and
    ApplicationServices configuration points.
    
    <invoke-factory>
      <construct class="org.apache.tapestry.services.impl.ServiceMapImpl">
        <set-configuration property="factoryServices" configuration-id="FactoryServices"/>
