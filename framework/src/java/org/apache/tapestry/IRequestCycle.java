/**
 *  Controller object that manages a single request cycle.  A request cycle
 *  is one 'hit' on the web server.  In the case of a Tapestry application,
 *  this will involve:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Responding to the URL by finding an {@link IEngineService} object
 *  <li>Determining the result page
 *  <li>Renderring the result page
 *  <li>Releasing any resources
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <p>Mixed in with this is:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Exception handling
 *  <li>Loading of pages and templates from resources
 *  <li>Tracking changes to page properties, and restoring pages to prior states
 *  <li>Pooling of page objects
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <p>A request cycle is broken up into two phases.   The <em>rewind</em> phase
 *  is optional, as it tied to {@link org.apache.tapestry.link.ActionLink} or
 *  {@link org.apache.tapestry.form.Form} components.  In the rewind phase,
 *  a previous page render is redone (discarding output) until a specific component
 *  of the page is reached.  This rewinding ensures that the page
 *  is restored to the exact state it had when the URL for the request cycle was
 *  generated, taking into account the dynamic nature of the page ({@link org.apache.tapestry.components.Foreach},
 *  {@link org.apache.tapestry.components.Conditional}, etc.).  Once this component is reached, it can notify
 *  its {@link IActionListener}.  The listener has the ability to update the state
 *  of any pages and select a new result page.
 *
 *  <p>Following the rewind phase is the <em>render</em> phase.  During the render phase,
 *  a page is actually rendered and output sent to the client web browser.
