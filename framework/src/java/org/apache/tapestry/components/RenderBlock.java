/**
 *  Renders the text and components wrapped by a {@link Block} component.
 *
 *  [<a href="../../../../../ComponentReference/RenderBlock.html">Component Reference</a>]
 *
 *  <p>It is possible for an RenderBlock to obtain a Block
 *  from a page <em>other than</em> the render page.  This works, even when
 *  the Block contains links, forms and form components.  The action and
 *  direct services will create URLs that properly address this situation.
 *
 *  <p>However, because the rendering page can't know
 *  ahead of time about these foriegn Blocks,
 *  {@link org.apache.tapestry.event.PageRenderListener} methods
 *  (for components and objects of the foriegn page)
 *  via RenderBlock will <em>not</em> be executed.  This specifically
 *  affects the methods of the {@link org.apache.tapestry.event.PageRenderListener} 
 *  interface.
 * 
 *  <p>Before rendering its {@link Block}, RenderBlock will set itself as the 
 *  Block's inserter, and will reset the inserter after the {@link Block} is 
 *  rendered.  This gives the components contained in the {@link Block} access
 *  to its inserted environment via the RenderBlock.  In particular this allows
 *  the contained components to access the informal parameters of the RenderBlock
 *  which effectively allows parameters to be passed to the components contained
 *  in a Block.
