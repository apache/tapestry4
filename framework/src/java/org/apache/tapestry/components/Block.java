/**

 *
 *  [<a href="../../../../../ComponentReference/Block.html">Component Reference</a>]
 *
 *  <p>Block and {@link RenderBlock} are used to build a certain class
 *  of complicated component that can't be assembled using the normal
 *  wrapping containment.  Such a super component would have two or more
 *  sections that need to be supplied by the containing page (or component).
 *
 *  <p>Using Blocks, the blocks can be provided as parameters to the super
 *  component.
 * 
 *  <p>The inserter property gives the components inside the block access to
 *  the component (typically an {@link RenderBlock}) that inserted the block,
 *  including access to its informal bindings which allows components contained
 *  by the Block to be passed parameters.  Note - it is the responsibility of the
 *  inserting component to set itself as the Block's inserter.
