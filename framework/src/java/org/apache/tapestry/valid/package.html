Components and classes that provide specialized, validating text fields.
The component {@link org.apache.tapestry.valid.ValidField}
does most of the work, and is paired with an implementation of
{@link org.apache.tapestry.valid.IValidator} (often as a helper bean)
which provides the rules of translation (between object value and string) and validation.

<p>
Fields can all be set as required or not; most IValidator implementations add additional
validations, such as fitting the input value between a minimum and maximum value.


<p>Fields can also have a {@link org.apache.tapestry.valid.FieldLabel} that reflects the state (normal or error)
of the field.
