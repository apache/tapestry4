    <description>
        The onevent element binds a task to a particular intrinsic event for the immediately enclosing element, ie,
        specifying an onevent element inside an "XYZ" element associates an intrinsic event binding with the "XYZ"
        element.
        The user agent must ignore any onevent element specifying a type that does not correspond to a legal
        intrinsic event for the immediately enclosing element.

    <parameter name="type" type="java.lang.String" direction="in" required="yes">
        <description>
            The type attribute indicates the name of the intrinsic event
            (ontimer, onenterforward, onenterbackward, onpick).
