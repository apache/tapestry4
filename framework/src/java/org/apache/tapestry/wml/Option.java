/**
 *  This component serves as a container for one item that is listed as a choice in a {@link Select}. A {@link Select}
 *  offers a selection of choices from which usersu may choose one or more items. The select list is created using a
 *  select element which contains a collection of option elements. A string or text describing the item appears between
 *  the opening and closing option tags.
 *
 *  In order to have a dynamic onpick attribute it is better to use a concrete class of
 *  {@link org.apache.tapestry.link.ILinkRenderer} with the {@link OptionRenderer}.
