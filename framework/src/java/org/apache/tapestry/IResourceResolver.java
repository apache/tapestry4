/**
 * An object which is used to resolve classes and class-path resources.
 * This is needed because, in an application server, different class loaders
 * will be loading the Tapestry framework and the specific Tapestry application.
 *
 * <p>The class loader for the framework needs to be able to see resources in
 * the application, but the application's class loader is a descendent of the
 * framework's class loader.  To resolve this, we need a 'hook', an instance
 * that provides access to the application's class loader.
 * 
 * <p>To more easily support OGNL, this interface now extends
 *  {@link ognl.ClassResolver}.
