The DTD for Tapestry application, library, page and component specifications.
Associated with the public identifier:

	-//Apache Software Foundation//Tapestry Specification 4.0//EN
	
The canonical location for the DTD is:

	http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/dtd/Tapestry_4_0.dtd

For application specifications, the root element is application.

For component specifications, the root element is component-specification.

For page specifications, the root element is page-specification.

For library specifiations, the root element is library-specification.

This DTD represents a significant change from (and simplification of) the 3.0 DTD. 
Tapestry 4.0 will continue to parse specifications that use the 3.0 DTD for the
forseable future.

The following changes have occured:

- <service> has been removed; it was used to define engine services, which
  is now accomplished using the HiveMind tapestry.services.ApplicationServices
  configuration point.
- <static-binding> and <message-binding> elements have been removed.
  There is now just <binding>, whose value attribute contains a prefix to interpret how
  the remainder of the value is interpreted (no prefix meaning a literal, or static, value).
- <property> renamed to <meta> and <property-specification> renamed to <property>
- Removed the type attribute from <property>
- <property> persistent attribute is now called "persist", and is a string, not a boolean
- Added <inject>
- Removed the direction and type attributes from <parameter>
- Consolidated <context-asset>, <private-asset> and <external-asset> into <asset>
- Consolidated <set-property> and <set-message-property> into <set>
- More flexibility on the order of elements
- Added property attribute to <component>, <bean> and <asset>
- Removed the type attribute from the <configure> element
- Added many alternatives to 'yes' and 'no' for boolean attributes.
- Added aliases and cache attributes to <parameter>
- Added deprecated to <component-specification>
- Removed <listener-binding>

Element: asset
Contained by: component-specification, page-specification

An asset that may be referenced by the component. Different prefixes
may be applied to the path indicate where the asset is stored; 
context: for the web application context folder or classpath:
for a file stored in the web applications' classpath.

Attributes:
  name: The name of the asset.
  path: The path for the resource, which may be relative or absolute.
  property: The name of a property that will be created to inject the
    asset into the component.

<!ATTLIST asset

  <!-- =======================================================
Element: bean
Appears in: component-specification, page-specification

Defines a JavaBean that will be used in some way by the component.  Beans
are accessible via the components' beans property (which contains a property
for each bean).  Beans are created as needed, and are discarded based on
the lifecycle attribute.  Beans are typically used to extend the
implementation of a component via aggregation.

Attributes:
  name: the name of the bean
  class: the Java class to instantiate
  lifecycle: when the reference to the bean should be discard
  	"none" no lifecycle, the bean is created and returned, but not stored
  	"request" the bean is retained until the end of the request cycle
  	"page" the bean is retained for the lifespan of the page
  	"render" (default) the bean is retained until the end of the current page render
  property: if specified, then a read-ony property is created in the component
    to access the bean.
    
Nothing prevents a bean for storing state; however, such state will
not be associated with any particular session (unlike persistant page
properties).  Further, because of page pooling, subsequent requests
from the same client may be serviced by different instances of a page and
(therefore) different bean instances.

Beans that have the "request" lifecycle may be stored into a pool
for later re-use (in the same or different page).

The bean may have its properties set.  Properties are set on both
newly instantiated beans, and beans that are retrieved from a pool.

  allow-body:  If yes (the default), the component may wrap other elements (have a body).
  allow-informal-parameters:  If yes (the default), informal parameters (parameters that are not
    explictily defined) are allowed.
  deprecated: If yes, then using the component will generate a warning, advising the user
    to find a different component. The default is no.

Defines a single page within the application.  Each application will contain
at least one of these, to define the Home page.

Element: meta
Contained by: (many other elements)

Defines a key/value pair associated with the application or component specification.  Properties
are used to capture information that doesn't fit into the DTD.  The value for the property is
either the value attribute, or the PCDATA wrapped by the property tag 
(which is trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace).

This should not be confused with several other tags which are used to set JavaBeans properties
of various objects.  The <property> tag exists to allow meta-data to be stored in the specification.

Attributes:
  key: The name of the property to set.
  value: If specified, is the value of the property, otherwise, the PCDATA is used.

Defines a formal parameter for the component.

Attributes:
  name: A unique name for the parameter.
  required: If yes, then the parameter must be bound.  If no (the default),
    then the parameter is optional.
  property: The name to use, instead of the parameter name, for the
    JavaBean property connected to this parameter.
  default-value: Specifies the default value for the parameter, if not bound,
    as a binding reference.
  cache: If true (the default), then the parameter property will cache the binding value
   If false, then each access to the property will re-acquire the the current value
   for the binding on each access (though invariant bindings may still be cached).
  aliases: An optional, comma-seperated list of aliases for the parameter. Used to allow
    compatibility when parameter names are changed.
  deprecated: If true, then using the parameter will generate a runtime warning.

   or leave blank for no persistence (that is, a transient property).  
   "session" is the most common strategy.

list identifies HTML attributes that are written exclusively
by the component and may not be affected by informal parameters.
