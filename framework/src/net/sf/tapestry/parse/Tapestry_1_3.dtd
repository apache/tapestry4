The DTD for Tapestry application, page and component specifications.
Associated with the public identifier:

	-//Howard Lewis Ship//Tapestry Specification 1.3//EN
	
The canonical location for the DTD is:

	http://tapestry.sf.net/dtd/Tapestry_1_3.dtd

For application specifications, the root element is application.

For component specifications, the root element is component-specification.

For page specifications, the root element is page-specification.

For library specifiations, the root element is library-specification.

This DTD is backwards compatible with the 1.2 DTD, with the following exceptions:
- specification (in 1.1) has been split into page-specification and component-specification
- added string-value element
- added library root element
- added library element
- added extension element
- added static value type 'long'

-->

<!-- =======================================================
Entity: attribute-flag

For entity attributesthat take a boolean value, defines 'yes' and 'no'.
The default varies, so isn't included here.
-->
<!ENTITY % attribute-flag "(yes|no)">


<!-- =======================================================
Entity: static-value-type

For entity attributes that take a string but convert it to a real
type.  Defaults to String.

Defines a Tapestry application.

Attributes:
  name: A textual name used to uniquely identify the application.

<!-- =======================================================
Element: bean
Appears in: specification

Defines a JavaBean that will be used in some way by the component.  Beans
are accessible via the components' beans property (which contains a property
for each bean).  Beans are created as needed, and are discarded based on
the lifecycle attribute.  Beans are typically used to extend the
implementation of a component via aggregation.

Attributes:
  name: the name of the bean
  class: the Java class to instantiate
  lifecycle: when the reference to the bean should be discard
  	"none" no lifecycle, the bean is created and returned, but not stored
  	"request" the bean is retained until the end of the request cycle
  	"page" the bean is retained for the lifespan of the page
  	
Nothing prevents a bean for storing state; however, such state will
not be associated with any particular session (unlike persistant page
properties).  Further, because of page pooling, subsequent requests
from the same client may be serviced by different instances of a page and
(therefore) different bean instances.

Beans that have the "request" lifecycle may be stored into a pool
for later re-use (in the same or different page).

The bean may have its properties set.  Properties are set on both
newly instantiated beans, and beans that are retrieved from a pool.
