    <title>Rollover</title>
  </header>
  
  <body>

<p>  The Rollover component provides a rollover image button for use with any kind of link 
 component. A rollover button image changes when the mouse move over it or off of it. 
 A Rollover is disabled if the link that wraps it is disabled (in which case it doesn't 
 respond to the mouse). If this dynamic behavior isn't required use the simpler &Image; 
 component.
 </p>
<p> The component provides all the necessary JavaScript to swap the image when the mouse 
enters and exits the button. However, the Rollover must be wrapped (ultimately) by a 
&Body; component.
</p>

       provided, to change the button to either it's base image, or its blur image.
