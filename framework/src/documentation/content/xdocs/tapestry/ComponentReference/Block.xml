  <em>No parameters</em>

  Reserved parameters: <em>none</em>

<p>
When a &Block; component renders normally, it does absolutely nothing.  It doesn't render any tag, or render its body.  However,
a &RenderBlock; component can be passed a Block instance, which will trigger the Block to render its body.
</p>

<p>
The parameters of the &RenderBlock;, including informal parameters, are indirectly available to the Block component.  The OGNL expression
components.<em>block</em>.getParameter("<em>name</em>") returns the value of a parameter bound to the &RenderBlock; which invoked 
the rendering of the Block's body.
