  <body>

<p>  A component for creating a link for an arbitrary engine service that uses no parameters, such as the reset or home service. A ServiceLink component can emulate an ActionLink, PageLink or DirectLink component, but is most often used in conjunction with an application-specific service.
</p>

<p>Prior to release 2.2, this component was named <strong>Service</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>See also: &ActionLink;, &DirectLink;, &ExternalLink;, &GenericLink;, &PageLink;</strong>

    <td>no</td>

    <td>
      The required scheme ("http" or "https", typically) for the URL.  This will force the creation
      of an absolute URL when the current request's scheme does not match the value for this parameter.
      This is most often used to switch to "https" for secure portions of an application
      (such as a login page), before switching back to standard "http" for the majority of an application.
