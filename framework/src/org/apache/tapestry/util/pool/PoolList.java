/**
 *  A wrapper around a list of objects for a given key in a {@link Pool}.
 *  The current implementation of this is FIFO.  This class is closely
 *  tied to {@link Pool}, which controls synchronization for it.
 *
 *  <p>This class, and {@link Pool}, were heavily revised in 1.0.5
 *  to support generational cleaning.  The PoolList acts like a first-in
 *  first-out queue and each pooled object is tagged with a "generation
 *  count", provided by the {@link Pool}. The generation count is
 *  incremented periodically.  This allows us to track, roughly,
 *  how often a pooled object has been accessed; unused objects will
 *  be buried with relatively low generation counts.
