	<description>
		The WMLSelect element lets users pick from a list of options. Each option is specified 
		by an Option element. Each Option element may have one line of formatted text 
		(which may be wrapped or truncated by the user agent if too long). 
		Option elements may be organised into hierarchical groups using the OptionGroup 
		element.

        <description>
            This attribute indicates that the select list should accept multiple selections. 
            When not set, the select list should only accept a single selected option.

            The name attribute indicates the name of the variable to set with the result 
            of the selection. The variable is set to the string value of the chosen option
            element, which is specified with the value attribute. The name variable's value 
            is used to pre-select options in the select list.
        </description>
    </parameter>

	<parameter name="value" type="java.lang.String" direction="in">
        <description>
            The value attribute indicates the default value of the variable named in the 
            name attribute. When the element is displayed, and the variable named in the 
            name attribute is not set, the name variable may be assigned the value 
            specified in the value attribute, depending on the values defined in iname and 
            ivalue. If the name variable already contains a value, the value attribute is 
            ignored. Any application of the default value is done before the list is 
            pre-selected with the value of the name variable.
            If this element allows the selection of multiple options, the result of the 
            user's choice is a list of all selected values, separated by the semicolon 
            character. The name variable is set with this result. In addition, the value 
            attribute is interpreted as a semicolon-separated list of pre-selected options.
