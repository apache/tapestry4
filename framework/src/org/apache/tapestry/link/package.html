<title>Tapestry: Web Application Framework</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Components for creating links on the page that trigger application behavior
when clicked.  These links are compatible with HTML and WML (they
use the basic &lt;a&gt; element).

<p>Each component is related to a different 
{@link org.apache.tapestry.engine.IEngineService}, except for {@link org.apache.tapestry.link.ServiceLink}
which is parameterized to use any of the available services ... which is useful with
applications that define their own services.

<p>Link components have a second function, to provide event handling support to the 
components they wrap.  This is how a {@link org.apache.tapestry.html.Rollover} component manages
to include DHTML and JavaScript that preloads the images and changes the displayed image as the
mouse enters and exits the "hot" area defined by the link.
