DTD for the files used with the ScriptParser class and Script component.  
This is recognized with the public identifier:

The root element is always script.
	
This DTD is backwards compatible with the 1.2 DTD, with the following exceptions:
- Addition of <unique> element
- Addition of unique attribute to <let> element
- Addition of index attribute to <foreach> element

Iterates over a list of items; this is modeled after the
Foreach component.  No iteration occurs if the value
from the property path is null.

Attributes:
  key: Defines the symbol into which each succesive value is stored.
  index: Defines the symbol into which the index of the value of the current iteration is stored.
  expression: The source of values, as an OGNL expression rooted in the symbols Map.

Element: input-symbol
Contained by: script

Defines an input symbol used by the script.
Attributes:
  key: The name of the symbol.
  class:  If specified, the exected class or interface for the symbol.
  required: If yes, then the symbol must be non-null.

Used to create a new symbol. The content of the tag
is used to create a string that is the name.  If the
unique flag is enabled, the name is ensured to be unique
(a suffix may be appended to ensure it is unique
among all names so generated).

Attributes:
  key: The name of the symbol to create.
  unique: If yes, the name is ensured to be unique.
  The default is no.

Element: script

Root element.

Allows zero or more let elements (to establish new symbols),
followed by a body and/or initialization element.

<!ELEMENT script (include-script*, input-symbol*, 
	(let | set)*, body?, initialization?)>
