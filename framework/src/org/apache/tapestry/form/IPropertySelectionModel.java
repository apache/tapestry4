/**
 *  Used by a {@link PropertySelection} to provide labels for options.
 *
 *  <p>The component requires three different representations
 *  of each option:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>The option value, a Java object that will eventually be assigned to
 *  a property
 *  <li>The label, a String which is incorprated into the HTML to identify the
 *  option to the user
 *  <li>The value, a String which is used to represent the option as the value
 *  of the &lt;option&gt; or &lt;input type=radio&gt; generated by the
 *  {@link PropertySelection}.
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <p>The option is usually either an {@link org.apache.commons.lang.enum.Enum} 
 *  (see {@link EnumPropertySelectionModel})
 *  or some kind of business object.  The label is often a property of the
 *  option object (for example, for a list of customers, it could be the customer name).
 *
 *  <p>It should be easy to convert between the value and the option.  It may simply
 *  be an index into an array.  For business objects, it is often the primary key
 *  of the object, expressed as a String.
