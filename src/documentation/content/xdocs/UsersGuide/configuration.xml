	<title>Configuring Tapestry</title>

<body>

<warning>
  Configuration is the area of greatest change between Tapestry 3.0 and Tapestry 3.1. Tapestry 3.1 has been
  restructured around &HiveMind;, which includes a very rich environment for services and
  configurations.
</warning>	
  
  
<p>
Tapestry is designed to operate on a variety of different JVMs and versions of 
the Java Servlet API. Below you can find the list of supported and 
tested configurations:
</p>
	
<dl>  
  <dt>Java 1.2.2</dt>
  <dd>
	Operates correctly. Requires the Xerces parser to be in the classpath 
	(usually provided by the servlet container).
  </dd>
  
	<dt>Java 1.3.x</dt>

  <dd>
	Operates correctly. Requires the Xerces parser to be in the classpath
	(usually provided by the servlet container).
  </dd>

	<dt>Java 1.4.x (recommended)</dt>
	

  <dd>
	Operates correctly.
  </dd>
</dl>



<p>
  Supported Java Servlet API Versions:
</p>
	
<dl>
	<dt>Java Servlet API 2.2</dt>
	
  <dd>
	Operates correctly with minor exceptions related to character encoding 
	of the requests due to the limitations of the Servlet API version.
  </dd>
	
  <dt>Java Servlet API 2.3 (recommended)</dt>
	
  <dd>
	Operates correctly.

<p>
All Tapestry applications make use of the &ApplicationServlet; class as their
servlet; it is rarely necessary to create a subclass. A typical web.xml configuration
maps the servlet to the /app path, and adds a servlet filter (discussed shortly):

</source>

	<p>
	The servlet class should always be &ApplicationServlet;.  There's rarely
	a need to create a subclass; Tapestry has many other hooks for extending the
	application.
	</p>
<p>
It is generally a good idea to specify 
&lt;load-on-startup&gt;, this causes
the servlet container to instantitate and initialize the the application servlet, which in turn,
reads the Tapestry application specification. Many common development errors will be spotted immediately,
rather than when the first application request arrives.
</p>	

	<p>
	The servlet is mapped to /app within the context.  The context
	itself has a path, determined by the application server and based on the name of the WAR file.
	
	The client web browser will see the Tapestry application
	as http://<em>host</em>/<em>war-name</em>/app.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Using /app as the URL is a common convention when creating
	Tapestry applications, but is not a requirement. If you choose an alternate URL,
  you must override the <code>org.apache.tapestry.servlet-path</code> configuration property.
	</p>

<p>
The &RedirectFilter; filter sends a client redirect to the user when they access the web application context. The filter
sends a client redirect to the user's browser, directing them to the application servlet. In this way,
the "public" URL for an application can be http://myserver/mycontext/ when, in fact,
the real address is http://myserver/mycontext/app.
</p>	

<p>
On initialization, the Tapestry servlet will locate its
application specification; a file that identifies details about the
application, the pages and components within it, and any
component libraries it uses.  Tapestry provides a great deal of
flexibility on where the specification is stored; trivial Tapestry
applications can operate without an application specification.
</p>

<fixme author="HLS">
This documentation is out of date with respect to &HiveMind;.  In 3.1, the servlet will create and initialize a HiveMind Registry.
</fixme>

<p>
The specification is normally
stored under WEB-INF.  In fact, Tapestry performs a search to find the specification:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
	On the classpath, as defined by the org.apache.tapestry.application-specification
	&configuration-property;.
</li>
<li>
	As /WEB-INF/<em>name</em>/<em>name</em>.application.
	The <em>name</em> is the servlet name.  This location
	is only used in the rare case of a single WAR containing multiple Tapestry
	applications.
</li>
<li>
	As /WEB-INF/<em>name</em>.application.
	Again, <em>name</em> is the
	servlet name.  This is the standard location.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the application specification still can not be found, then an empty, "stand in"
application specification is used. This is perfectly acceptible ... an application specification is typically
needed only when an application makes use of component libraries, or requires some other kind of customization
only possible with an application specification.
</p>
	
	
</section>  <!-- configuration.deployment-descriptor -->

<section id="configuration.search-path">
	<title>Configuration Search Path</title>
	
<p>
Tapestry occasionally must obtain a value for a configuration property.    These configuration
properties are items that are frequently optional, and don't fit into any particular
specification.  Many are related to the runtime environment, such as which class to instantiate as the
Visit object.
</p>

<p>
Tapestry
is very flexible about where values for such properties may be obtained.  In general,
the search path for configuration properties is:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		As a &spec.meta; of the &spec.application; (in the application specification,
		if the application uses one).
	</li>
	<li>
		As an &init-parameter;
		for the servlet, in the web application deployment descriptor.
	</li>
	<li>
		As an &init-parameter;
		for the servlet context, also in the web application deployment descriptor.
	</li>
	<li>
		As a JVM system property.
	</li>
	<li>
		Hard-coded "factory" defaults (for some properties). These are accessed as 
    &HiveMind; symbols.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is expected that some configurations are not defined at any level; those will
return null.
</p>


<p>
Applications are free to leverage this lookup mechanism as well.  &IEngine; defines
a propertySource property (of type &IPropertySource;)
that can be used to perform such lookups.
</p>

<p>
Applications may also want to change or augment
the default search path; this is accomplished by overriding
&AbstractEngine; method <code>createPropertySource()</code>.  For example,
some configuration data could be drawn from a database.
</p>

<fixme author="HLS">
  The previous paragraph is out of date; extension of the search path will
  involve a HiveMind contribution, details to be provided.
</fixme>

The following are all the configuration values
currently used in Tapestry:
</p>
	
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>org.apache.tapestry.servlet-path</td>
    <td>
    Defines the servlet path used when constructing URLs. The default value is <code>/app</code>.   Note that this is just
    the <em>servlet path</em>.  In many cases, the application will be inside a context; Tapestry will automatically prefix this
    value with the correct value for the context.  For example, workbench.war will by default be deployed with a context path of /workbench, and Tapestry will build URLs as
    /workbench/app.
    </td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td>org.apache.tapestry.template-extension</td>
	
	<td>
	Overrides the default extension used to locate templates for pages or components.
	The default extension is "html", this configuration property 
	allows overrides where appropriate.  For example,
	an application that produces WML may want to override this to "wml".

	
	<p>
	This configuration property does not follow the normal search path rules.  The
	&spec.meta; must be provided in the &spec.page-specification; or &spec.component-specification;.
	If no value is found there, the immediate containing &spec.application; or
	&spec.library-specification; is checked.  If still not found, the default is used.
	</p>
	
	</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>

	

	<td>org.apache.tapestry.asset.dir, org.apache.tapestry.asset.URL</td>
	
  <td>
	These two values are used to handle private assets.  Private assets are assets
	that are stored on the classpath, and not normally visible to client web browsers.

	
	<p>
	By specifying these two configuration values, Tapestry can export private assets
	to a directory that is visible to the client web browser.  The URL
	value should map to the directory specified by the dir value.
	</p>
  </td>
  
  </tr>


  <tr>
	<td>org.apache.tapestry.visit-class</td>
	
  <td>
	The fully qualified class name to instantiate as the 
	<link href="index.html#intro.engine-service-visit">Visit object</link>.
	
	<p>
	If not specified, an instance of HashMap will be created.
	</p>
	
  </td>
  </tr>


  <tr>

	<td>org.apache.tapestry.default-page-class</td>
	
  <td>
	By default, any page that omits the
	class attribute (in its &spec.page-specification;)
	will be instantiated as &BasePage;.  If this is not desired,
	the default may be overridden by specifying a fully
	qualified class name.
  </td>

</tr>

<tr>
	<td>org.apache.tapestry.engine-class</td>
	
  <td>
	The fully qualified class name to instantiate as the application engine.
	This configuration value is only used when the 
	application specification does not exist, or fails to
	specify a class.  By default, &BaseEngine; is used if this configuration
	value is also left unspecified.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>org.apache.tapestry.enhance.disable-abstract-method-validation</td>	
	
  <td>
	Used to trigger a work around for a bug in IBM's JDK 1.3.1. This particular JDK reports <em>all</em> methods
	of an abstract class as abstract, even if they are, in fact, concrete. This causes spurious errors
	about unimplemented abstract methods. Specifying true for this property
	disables checks for unimplemented abstract methods.
  
  <warning>
    Support for this property has been temporarily removed from release 3.1.
  </warning>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>org.apache.tapestry.global-class</td>
	
  <td>
	The fully qualified class name to instantiate as the engine global
	property.  The Global object is much like Visit object, 
	except that it is shared by all instances
	of the application engine rather than being private to any particular session.
	If not specified, a synchronized instance of HashMap is used.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>org.apache.tapestry.default-script-language</td>
	
  <td>
	The name of a &BSF;-supported language, used when a
	&spec.listener-binding; element does not specify
	a language.  If not overridden, the default is "jython".
  </td>
	
	</tr>

<tr>

	<td>org.apache.tapestry.enable-reset-service</td>
	
  <td>
	If not specified as "true", then the reset service
	will be non-functional.  The reset service is used to force
	the running Tapestry application to discard all cached data (including
	templates, specifications, pooled objects and more).  This must
	be explicitly enabled, and should only be used in development (in production,
	it is too easily exploited as a denial of service attack).
	
	<p>
	Unlike most other configuration values, this must be specified
	as a JVM system property.
	</p>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>org.apache.tapestry.disable-caching</td>
	
  <td>
	If specified (as "true"), then the framework will discard all cached data
	(specifications, templates, pooled objects, etc.) at the end of each request cycle.
	
	<p>
	This slows down request handling by a noticable amount, but is very
	useful in development; it means that changes to templates and specifications
	are immediately visible to the application.  It also helps identify
	any errors in managing persistent page state.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This should never be enabled in production; the performance hit is too large.
	Unlike most other configuration values, this must be specified
	as a JVM system property.
	</p>
  </td>

<tr>
	<td>org.apache.tapestry.output-encoding</td>
	
  <td>
	Defines the character set used by the application to encode its HTTP responses. 
	This is also the character set that the application assumes that the browser uses 
	when submitting data unless it is not specified differently in the HTTP request.

	<p>
	The default for this configuration property is UTF-8. 
	Normally there is no need to modify this value since UTF-8 allows almost all
	characters to be correctly encoded and displayed.
	</p>
  </td>

</tr>

<tr>
	<td>org.apache.tapestry.template-encoding</td>
	
  <td>
	Defines the character set used by the application templates.

	<title>Application extensions</title>
  
<warning>
  Application extensions are deprecated as of release 3.1.  The use of &HiveMind; services and
  contributions eliminates the need for extensions.
</warning>  
	
<p>Tapestry is designed for flexibility; this extends beyond simply 
configuring the framework, and encompasses actually replacing or augmenting the implementation
of the framework.  If Tapestry doesn't do what you want it to, there are multiple paths
for extending, changing and overriding its normal behavior.
  In some cases,
	it is necessary to subclass framework classes in order to alter behavior, but in
	many cases, it is possible to use an application extension.
	</p>
	
<p>
	Application extensions are JavaBeans declared in the application specification using
	the &spec.extension; element.  Each extension consists of a name, a Java class
	to instantiate, and an optional configuration (that is, properties of the
	bean may be set).  The framework has a finite number of extension points.  If an extension
	bean with the correct name exists, it will be used at that extension point.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Your application may have its own set of extensions not related to Tapestry framework extension points.
	For example, you might have an application extension referenced from multiple pages to perform common
	operations such as JNDI lookups.	
	</p>
	
	<p>
	You may access application extensions via the engine's specification property. For example:
	</p>
  
<source>
&IEngine; engine = getEngine();
&IApplicationSpecification; specification = engine.getSpecification();
	
MyExtension myExtension = (MyExtension) specification.getExtension("myExtension");	
</source>
	
	
	<p>
	Each application extension used with an framework extension point must implement an interface particular
	to the extension point.
	</p>

<section id="configuration.character-sets">
	<title>Character Sets</title>

<p>
Tapestry is designed to make the web application localization easy and 
offers the ability to define different localized templates for the same component.
For example, Home.html would be the default template of the Home page, however
Home_fr.html would be used in all French locales, while Home_zh_CN.html would be used in
China and Home_zh_TW.html would be used in Taiwan.
</p>

<p>
Web developers and designers in different countries tend to use different character sets 
for the templates they produce. English, German, French templates are typically produced in
ISO-8859-1, Russian templates often use KOI8-R, and Chinese texts are normally written in Big5.
Tapestry allows the application to configure the character set used in its templates 
and makes it possible to use different character sets for templates associated with 
different components and different locales.
</p>

<p>
The character set of a template is defined using the 
org.apache.tapestry.template-encoding
&configuration-property;. The search path of this property is slightly different then the
standard one and allows specific components to use other character sets:
</p>
	
<ul>
	<li>
		As a &spec.meta; of the &spec.page-specification; or the &spec.component-specification; 
		(in the page or component specification). 
		<p>
		This configuration will apply only to the page or component where it is defined.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		As a &spec.meta; of the &spec.library-specification; 
		(in the library specification, if the components are included in a library). 
		<p>
		This configuration will apply to all pages and components in the library.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		As a &spec.meta; of the &spec.application; (in the application specification,
		if the application uses one).
	</li>
	<li>
		As an &init-parameter;
		for the servlet, in the web application deployment descriptor.
	</li>
	<li>
		As an &init-parameter;
		for the servlet context, also in the web application deployment descriptor.
	</li>
	<li>
		As a JVM system property.
	</li>
	<li>
		The hard-coded default "ISO-8859-1".
	</li>
</ul>
	
<p>
Tapestry also makes it possible to define the character set used by the templates specific 
to a particular locale by appending the locale to the property name above. 
As an example, the 
org.apache.tapestry.template-encoding_ru configuration property would define
the character set used by the Russian templates, such as Home_ru.html. 
This allows templates for different locales to use different character sets, 
even though they are in the same application. 
For example, it is possible for all Russian templates in the application to use the KOI8-R 
character set and all Chinese templates to use Big5 at the same time.
</p>

<p>
The character sets used by the templates do not reflect in any way on the character set 
Tapestry uses to encode its response to the browser. The character sets are used when reading
the template to translate it appropriately into Unicode.
The output character set is defined by the 
org.apache.tapestry.output-encoding &configuration-property;.
