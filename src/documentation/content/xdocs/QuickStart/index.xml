<p>
This is the Tapestry Quick Start; basic documentation to get your started using Tapestry.
The <link href="../UsersGuide/">Users Guide</link> is conceptual; it provides the gritty details.
This Quick Start is about getting you running with Tapestry.
</p>

<section>
  <title>Pre-requisistes</title>
  
<p>
You will need a Java JDK to get started.  We'll be using some of the
<link href="../tapestry-annotations/">Tapestry Annotations</link>, which require
<strong>JDK 1.5</strong>.
</p>  

<p>
The examples build with &Ant;, version 1.6.2 or better is required.
</p>
  
<p>
The examples all share a set of libraries (the Tapestry framework, its dependencies, the
contrib library, and the annotations library).  These are available from <link href="&quickstart-download-url;">&quickstart-download-url;</link>
as file tapestry-libraries.tar.gz.  Choose a directory to store the tutorials and expand the contents of this tarball; this will
create a directory, tapestry-libraries, with files and folders beneath it (especially, many JAR files
inside lib/web).

  <title>Tutorial Structure</title>
  
<p>
Each tutorial is its own project (in fact, it includes .project and .classpath files so that it may be
used inside &Eclipse;).  Each should be expanded inside your tutorials directory:

<p>
Each individual tutorial has the same structure:
</p>

<p>
The  src/conf folder contains just a log4j.properties file, to set up logging for the applilcation
as it runs.
</p>

<p>
The src/context folder contains the files that will populate the web application archive; this includes
HTML files, stylesheets, and images. Within the WEB-INF folder will be the standard web.xml deployment
descriptor, plus additional Tapestry related files.
</p>

<p>
The Ant <code>war</code> target will compile the Java source files, and create a WAR file containing
the compiled classes (inside WEB-INF/classes), the contents of src/context, and all the dependencies (from tapestry-libraries)
packaged inside WEB-INF/lib.  The file will be stored in the target folder, which is created
as necessary, and is named after the project (i.e., target/helloworld.war).
