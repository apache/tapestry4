<p>
This is the Tapestry Quick Start; basic documentation to get your started using Tapestry.
The <link href="../UsersGuide/">Users Guide</link> is conceptual; it provides the gritty details.
This Quick Start is about getting you running with Tapestry.
</p>

<section>
  <title>Pre-requisistes</title>
  
<p>
You will need a Java JDK to get started.  We'll be using some of the
<link href="../tapestry-annotations/">Tapestry Annotations</link>, which require
<strong>JDK 1.5</strong>.
</p>  

<p>
The examples build with &Ant;, version 1.6.2 or better is required.
</p>
  
<p>
The source code for the all the tutorials are distributed inside a single tarbar: tapestry-tutorials.tar.gz, available
from <link href="&quickstart-download-url;">&quickstart-download-url;</link>.
</p>  
    
<p>
Each tutorial is its own project (in fact, it includes .project and .classpath files so that it may be
used inside &Eclipse;).  In addition, the tapestry-tutorials project contains the set of libraries
need by the applications: the Tapestry libraries and their dependencies.
</p>

<p>
Each tutorial project has the same structure:
</p>

<figure src="single-tutorial.png" alt="Single Tutorial Structure"/>
 
  
<p>
The  src/conf folder contains just a log4j.properties file, to set up logging for the applilcation
as it runs.
</p>

<p>
The src/context folder contains the files that will populate the web application archive; this includes
HTML files, stylesheets, and images. Within the WEB-INF folder will be the standard web.xml deployment
descriptor, plus additional Tapestry related files.
</p>

<p>
The Ant <code>war</code> target will compile the Java source files (stored in src/java), and create a WAR file containing
the compiled classes (inside WEB-INF/classes), the contents of src/context, and all the dependencies (from tapestry-libraries)
packaged inside WEB-INF/lib.  The file will be stored in the target folder, which is created
as necessary, and is named after the project (i.e., target/helloworld.war).
</p>

  <title>Building And Deploying</title>
  
<p>
To build a tutorial, simply change to its directory and execute <code>ant</code>:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
bash-2.05b$ ant
Buildfile: build.xml

compile:
    [mkdir] Created dir: C:\workspace\directlink\target\classes
    [javac] Compiling 1 source file to C:\workspace\directlink\target\classes
    [javac] Note: C:\workspace\directlink\src\java\tutorials\directlink\pages\Home.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.
    [javac] Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.

war:
      [war] Building war: C:\workspace\directlink\target\helloworld.war

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 8 seconds
bash-2.05b$
]]></source>

<p>
The resulting WAR file is ready to be deployed into any servlet container such as &Jetty; or &Tomcat;.
</p>
