    <title>QuickStart: Forms</title>

<body>

<p>
In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of Tapestry forms, and gain an understanding of the lifecycle of
a Tapestry application.  We'll also see how to transfer information from one
page to another.
</p>	

<p>
The theme of this tutorial is an application used to track third-party libraries for Tapestry.
Each project will have a number of properties:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>name</li>
	<li>release ID</li>
	<li>short and long description</li>
	<li>category</li>
	<li>supported Tapestry version</li>
	<li>release date</li>
	<li>public (visible to others) or private (visible only to the owner)</li>
</ul>
	
<p>
	Later tutorials will return to this theme, and cover the issues related to
	accessing data from a database. For this tutorial, we're just going to collect
	the above data (in an Add Project page), and then echo it back to the user.
</p>	
	
<section>
	<title>Home Page</title>
	
<p>
The Home page for our application is very simple, it doesn't require a Java class:
</p>	

<source><![CDATA[
<html jwcid="@Shell" title="Tapestry Component Database">
<body>
	
<h1>Tapestry Component Database</h1>

<p>
  Options:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a jwcid="@PageLink" page="AddProject">Add New Project</a></li>
</ul>
	
	
</body>
</html>
]]></source>
	
<p>
We've introduced another handy component, &Shell;.  This component is just a 
convienience for generating the &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;title&gt; tags (though
it has quite a few other tricks up its sleeve).
</p>	
	
	
</section>	

<section>
	<title>Value Object</title>
	
<p>
	One of the cornerstones of Tapestry is the ability to edit properties of value objects directly.
	These value objects, in a real application, will be read from the databsae, editted by Tapestry
	components, then written back into the database.
</p>

<p>
	Objects editted by Tapestry in this manner have <em>no</em> requirements.  Unlike pages, they don't
	have to extend a base class or implement an interface. They are truly the <strong>Model</strong>
	in the <strong>Model-View-Controller Pattern</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	For this tutorial, we're using a very simple value object:
</p>

	<title>AddProject Page</title>
	
<p>
	As we've seen, the Home page includes a link to the AddProject page; the AddProject page
	will contain the form that collects the data about the project before storing it into a database.
	We don't have a database in this example, but we can still collect the data.

      <input type="submit" value="Add Project"/>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>]]></source>	
	
<p>
This template introduces a number of new components:
</p>  

<ul>
  <li>&Body; -- organizes the JavaScript generated for the page (needed to use the &DatePicker;)</li>
  <li>&Form; -- generates an HTML form and controls the submit behavior</li>
  <li>&TextField; -- creates a text field (&lt;input type="text"/&gt;) used to <em>edit</em> (read and update) a property
    of the page</li>
  <li>&TextArea; -- as with &TextField;, but generates a multi-line &lt;textarea&gt;</li>
  <li>&DatePicker; -- a JavaScript popup calendar</li>
  <li>&Checkbox;-- edits a <em>boolean</em> property of the page</li> 
</ul>

<p>
The &Form;'s success parameter is linked to a listener method. It is invoked only when there
are no validation errors. We'll discuss validation in a later tutorial.
</p>

<p>
 The &Body; component plays a crucial role in Tapestry; it organizes all the JavaScript generated when
 a page renders. It assists components with generated unique names for client-side variables and functions,
 and organizes all the JavaScript generated by all the component within the page into two large blocks (one at
 the top of the page, one at the bottom). The &DatePicker; component will not operate unless it is
 enclosed by a &Body; component.
</p>
  
<p>
The &TextField; and &TextArea; components edit properties of the page.  Because the value
parameter is an &OGNL; expression, it is not limited to editting properties directly exposed
by the page class; it can follow property paths. We'll see how to define the project
property of the page shortly.
</p>

<p>
  As you can see, Tapestry offers a number of components for editting specific types of properties. In addition,
  we'll see in a bit how the existing components can be configured for editting other types as well.
</p>

<p>
  As the template shows, this page is reliant on 
  having a specific Java class, with a doSubmit() listener method and a project property. Let's create that next.
</p>

</section>

<section>
  <title>AddProject Page Class</title>
  
<p>
  Let's start with the minimum for this class and add details as necessary.
</p>  

<source><![CDATA[package tutorial.forms.pages;

import org.apache.tapestry.html.BasePage;

import tutorial.forms.data.ProjectRelease;

/**
 * Java class for the AddProject page; contains a form used to collect data for creating a new
 * {@link tutorial.forms.data.ProjectRelease}.
 * 
 * @author Howard M. Lewis Ship
 */
public abstract class AddProject extends BasePage
{
    public abstract ProjectRelease getProject();

    public void doSubmit()
    {

    }
}
]]></source>
  
<p>
  Maybe this is too minimal; if we launch the application and choose the Add New Project link, we
  get an exception:
</p>  

<figure src="&images-url;/forms1.png" alt="Null Pointer Exception"/>
  
<p>
  The root of this exception is a null value:  we defined a place to store a ProjectRelease object
  but didn't actually provide an instance.  &OGNL; attempted to dereference through the null value
  and threw the OgnlException. Here we can see the advantage of Tapestry's exception reporting ... showing the 
  stack of exceptions gave us context into our application (the line in the template associated with the
  error) without obscuring the underlying cause.
</p>  

<p>
  What we need to do is create an instance of ProjectRelease and store it into
  the property so that the &TextField; components can edit it.  We have to be careful
  because in a live application, pages will be pooled and reused constantly. The best approach in Tapestry is to
  listen to a <em>page lifecycle event</em> and create the ProjectRelease object just as needed.
</p>

<p>
  For this situation, the right approach is to listen for the PageBeginRender event, and
  store the new instance into the property then.  The ProjectRelease object will be used for the
  duration of the request, then discarded ata the end of the request.
</p>

<p>
  Listening for these lifecycle events is simple; you just need to select the correct listener interface
  and implement it; Tapestry will automatically register your page to receive the notifications.  Here,
  the interface is &PageBeginRenderListener;:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[package tutorial.forms.pages;

import java.util.Date;

import org.apache.tapestry.event.PageBeginRenderListener;
import org.apache.tapestry.event.PageEvent;
import org.apache.tapestry.html.BasePage;

import tutorial.forms.data.ProjectRelease;

/**
 * Java class for the AddProject page; contains a form used to collect data for creating a new
 * {@link tutorial.forms.data.ProjectRelease}.
 * 
 * @author Howard M. Lewis Ship
 */
public abstract class AddProject extends BasePage implements PageBeginRenderListener
{
    public abstract ProjectRelease getProject();

    public abstract void setProject(ProjectRelease project);

    public void pageBeginRender(PageEvent event)
    {
        ProjectRelease project = new ProjectRelease();

        project.setReleaseDate(new Date());

        setProject(project);
    }

    public void doSubmit()
    {

    }
}
]]></source>
  
<p>
  The pageBeginRender() method will be invoked whenever the page renders. It is also, due to a useful quirk of Tapestry,
  invoked when a form within the page is submitted. Not only can we create an instance, but we
  have the opportunity to set some initial values for fields.
</p>  
  
<p>
  With this in place, the page will now render:
</p>  

<figure src="&images-url;/forms2.png" alt="AddProject Page"/>
