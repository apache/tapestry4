    <title>Tapestry Examples</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p> Tapestry's main distribution includes the Tapestry JAR files plus all source code for Tapestry, the Tapestry
      documentation, and Tapestry examples. </p>
    <p> Because of licensing concerns, JAR dependencies (such as Javassist) and example applications are not distributed
      with Tapestry itself. As an Apache Software Foundation project, the Tapestry distributions <em>must</em> be
      limited to just software directly provided by the ASF; nothing from outside the ASF is allowed. </p>
    <p> If you like, you can easily (?) build Tapestry, including the examples, from source. The necessary dependencies
      are automatically downloaded by Ant build scripts, but it takes some elbow grease to set up. Details at <link
        href="http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-tapestry/BuildingTapestry">the Wiki</link>. </p>
    <p>
      <strong>But wouldn't it be nice to just get the compiled examples, ready to take for a spin? </strong> We think
      so, so we now provide the examples, precompiled, packaged, and ready to go, as a seperate distribution, from a 
      non-ASF server. </p>
    <p> These examples are available at <link href="http://howardlewisship.com/downloads/quick-start/"
        >http://howardlewisship.com/downloads/quick-start/</link>
        as
        <code>tapestry-examples-</code><em>version</em><code>.tar.gz</code>.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      The distribution is a snapshot of a <link href="http://jboss.org/">JBoss</link> 4.0.2 instance, with two Tapestry applications
      deployed into it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To make use of it, unpack the distribution, which will create
      a <code>jboss-tapestry-examples-</code><em>version</em> directory.  Change to the
      <code>bin</code> sub-directory and execute the <code>run.bat</code> or <code>run.sh</code>
      startup script.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      JBoss will start up and you'll be able to access the two demonstration applications.
    </p>

      <title>Workbench</title>

      <p> The workbench is a testbed for many common Tapestry components. The tabs across the top demonstrate different
        Tapestry features and components, including localization, input validation, exception reporting, and the Palette
        and Table components. </p>

      <p> The Virtual Library is a small but complete J2EE application. It uses J2EE Entity beans with container managed
        persistence, and a stateless session facade, with Tapestry on the front end. The application is used to manage a
        shared pool of books, tracking who owns and who is currently borrowing each book. </p>
      <p> Three users are built into the library. All three use the same password, "secret":</p>
      <ul>
        <li>dilbert@bigco.com</li>
        <li>squeue@bug.org</li>
        <li>ringbearer@bagend.shire</li>
      </ul>
      <p> The "ringbearer" user has administrative access.  When logged in as ringbearer, you'll see
      additional menu options for managing users and publishers. </p>
