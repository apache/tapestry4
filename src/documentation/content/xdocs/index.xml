  <title>Jakarta Tapestry - Welcome!</title>
 </header>

<body>
		
<p>
Tapestry is a powerful, open-source, all-Java framework
for creating leading edge web applications in Java.
</p>

<p>
Tapestry reconceptualizes web application development 
in terms of objects, methods and properties
instead of URLs and query parameters.
</p>

<p>
Tapestry is an alternative to scripting environments such as
JavaServer Pages or Velocity.  Tapestry goes far further,
providing a complete framework for creating extremely dynamic applications
with minimal amounts of coding.
</p>

<p>
Tapestry's approach, using a component object model similar to a
traditional GUI, provides the following benefits:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Very high level of reuse, within and between projects<br/><em>Everything in Tapestry is a reusable component</em></li>
<li>Frees developers from writing boring, buggy code<br/><em>Code in terms of objects, methods and properties, not URLs and query parameters</em></li>
<li>Allows applications' complexity to scale well<br/><em>Framework does all the URL building and message dispatching, transparently</em></li>
<li>Easy Internationalization/Localization<br/><em>Framework selects localized version of text, templates and images</em></li>
<li>Extremely robust applications<br/><em>Less code is less bugs<br/>Sophisticated built-in exception reporting<br/><link href="faq.html#lineprecise">Line precise error reporting</link></em></li>
<li>Easy team integration<br/><em>Graphic designers and Java developers can work together without having to know each other's jobs</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
Tapestry is distributed under the terms of the Apache Software License.
</p>

<p>Tapestry exploits the dynamic nature of the Java language, leveraging 
the JavaBeans API, as well as servlets and other J2EE technology.
Tapestry applications are fast, scalable, robust and powerful.
</p>

<p>
Tapestry components are a combination of a specification file (in XML),
an HTML template and a Java class (extending a framework class,
with simple additions). Tapestry components are combined together
 to form larger components or complete Tapestry pages.
