<p>
Tapestry is a powerful, open-source, all-Java framework
for creating leading edge web applications in Java.
</p>

<p>
Tapestry reconceptualizes web application development 
in terms of objects, methods and properties
instead of URLs and query parameters. It allows you to build sophisticated, richly interactive, highly scalable
web applications without any concern for HTTP ... or even the Servlet API!  Tapestry takes over all the tedious 
and error-prone aspects of web application development, letting you focus on just the parts specific to your
application.
</p>

<p>
Tapestry is an alternative to scripting environments such as
JavaServer Pages or Velocity.  Tapestry goes far further,
providing a complete framework for creating extremely dynamic applications
with minimal amounts of coding.
</p>

<p>
Tapestry's approach, using a component object model similar to a
traditional GUI, provides the following benefits:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Very high level of reuse, within and between projects
  <p><em>Everything in Tapestry is a reusable component</em></p></li>
<li>Frees developers from writing boring, buggy code
  <p><em>Code in terms of objects, methods and properties, not URLs and query parameters</em></p></li>
<li>Allows applications' complexity to scale well
  <p><em>Framework does all the URL building and message dispatching, transparently</em></p></li>
<li>Easy Internationalization/Localization
  <p><em>Framework selects localized version of text, templates and images</em></p></li>
  
<li>Extremely robust applications
  <p><em>Less code is less bugs<br/>Sophisticated built-in exception reporting<br/><link href="faq.html#lineprecise">Line precise error reporting</link></em></p></li>
  
<li>Easy team integration
  <p><em>Graphic designers and Java developers can work together without having to know each other's jobs</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Tapestry has been developed using the guiding principals of <strong>Simplicity</strong>,
<strong>Consistency</strong>, <strong>Efficiency</strong> and
<strong>Feedback</strong>. Tapestry is focused on improving developer productivity; the goal of Tapestry is to
ensure that, when developing your applications, <em>the simplest approach is also the <strong>correct</strong> approach</em>.

  <title>Status</title>
  
<p>
Work has begun on Tapestry 3.1, which is currently in an early alpha stage.  Documentation is being converted
from the old DocBook format, to the new Forrest format, leaving many temporary gaps. Only the framework and the contrib
library is being built, example code is not.
</p>

<p>
If you are using Tapestry in a production environment, it is recommended that you stick with Tapestry <strong>3.0</strong>,
the latest stable release.
