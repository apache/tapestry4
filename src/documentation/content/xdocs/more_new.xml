<p>
The <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/doc/ComponentReference/ValidField.html">ValidField</link> now performs
client-side validation of input.  If a field is in error when the form
is submitted, then an alert is displayed and the field is selected.
</p>

<p>Begin making more use of OGNL expressions in place of Java code.
</p>

<p>Malcom Edgar has contributed a <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/doc/ComponentReference/DatePicker.html">DatePicker</link>
component.
</p>

<p>Some more refactorings: IComponent methods  addWrapped()/renderWrapped() -&gt; addBody()/renderBody().
</p>

<p>Tapestry documentation is now available in PDF format.
</p>

[ 607451 ] log error when unmatched components
</source>

</section>

<section><title>Release 2.2-beta-1</title>

<p>Tapestry has now replaced its simple
property path support with the far 
more powerful <link href="http://www.ognl.org">Object Graph
Navigation Library</link> expressions.  This promises to greatly extend
the expressiveness of the specifications and further reduce
the need for Java code.  The <code>property-path</code>
attribute of the <code>&lt;binding&gt;</code> element has been renamed
to <code>expression</code> (this only affects the latest, 1.3, version
of the DTD).
</p>

<p>There are some small costs to using OGNL; the largest being
a restriction in bean names, component ids and asset names.  All
of these must now be valid Java identifiers, and so cannot contain the 
dash ('-') character, which was previously permitted.  This affects all
specifications, including older versions.
</p>

<p>Malcolm Edgar has lead the push to provide an excellent
<link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/doc/ComponentReference">Tapestry Component Reference</link>.
</p>

<p>
You can now control the exact location of a component template by 
declaring an asset named <code>$template</code> (which is not normally
a legal asset name, due to the dollar sign).  If such an asset exists,
then it is used as the template.
</p>

<p>A number of poorly named components have been renamed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Action -&gt; ActionLink</li>
<li>Direct -&gt; DirectLink</li>
<li>InsertBlock -&gt; RenderBlock</li>
<li>InsertWrapped -&gt; RenderBody</li>
<li>Page -&gt; PageLink</li>
<li>Service -&gt; ServiceLink</li>
<li>ShowInspector -&gt; InspectorButton</li>
<li>Text -&gt; TextArea</li> 
</ul>

<p>Previous names will be maintained until at least release 2.3.
</p>

<p>
In addition, the documentation has been brought (largely) up to date
with the significant changes so far in release 2.2.
</p>

<source>
[ 582421 ] Way to specify template location
[ 596929 ] NumericField params require java-type

<section><title>Release 2.2-alpha-3</title>

<p>
Tapestry now supports libraries, which can provide components, pages and engine services to
an application.  Libraries can also include libraries.  The application specification
has been ammended to include a new &lt;library&gt; element, and a new type of specification,
the library specification, has been added.

</p>

<p>Minor formatting changes to the web site and Virtual Library.
</p>

</section>

<section><title>Release 1.0.10</title>

<p>
Changed the build to include debugging symbols with the frameworks.  Fixed a deployment problem with
the Tutorial.  Added descriptions to most components and parameters.  Modified the Inspector to
display component and parameter descriptions.
</p>

<p>Added a new page to the Workbench Tutorial: Chart.  The Chart page allows a user to dynamically
create a pie chart.
</p>

<p>Made it easier to create subclasses of 
<link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/AbstractResponseWriter.html">AbstractResponseWriter</link>.

[ 532815 ] ValidationDelegate errors
[ 532758 ] add descriptions to builtin components
[ 499655 ] HTMLResponseWriter enhancements
</source>

</section>

<section><title>Release 1.0.9</title>

<p>The framework and contrib jar files are now named with the release number (i.e.,
<code>com.primix.tapestry-1.0.9.jar</code>).  In addition, 
the source code for these frameworks, and the examples, is now distributed as 
Jar files instead of directories of files in the <code>src</code> directory. 
This makes for easier source lookup when using 
<link href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</link>, and shrinks the size of the distribution
as well.
</p>

<p>The way engine services are defined and used has been completely overhauled.  </p>

<p>
Services are now defined
in the application specification and a single
instance of the service object is instantiated
and shared by all engine instances (for the application).
</p>

<p>Made it easier to override the creation of the specification source, template source, etc. in subclasses
of 
<link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/engine/AbstractApplication.html">AbstractApplication</link>.
</p>

<p>The <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/form/Submit.html">Submit</link> and 
<link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/form/ImageSubmit.html">ImageSubmit</link> components may now have 
their own listener, which is notified before the containing form's listener.
</p>

<p>More reworking of validation; the validation delegate can now
track errors in any kind of form component and can track errors that
aren't associated with any particular component.
</p>

<source>
[ #510175 ] add service registration to .application
[ #511256 ] Enhance Validation Framework
</source>

</section>

<section><title>Release 1.0.8</title>

<p>A complete overhaul of the validating text field support.  The previous implementation
used subclasses of AbstractValidatingTextField (which no longer exists) to add new types
of validation; the new implementation has a single component, 
<link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/valid/ValidField.html">ValidField</link>, and many implementations
of <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/valid/IValidator.html">IValidator</link>.
</p>

<p>At long last, the <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/form/Upload.html">Upload</link> component.
</p>

<p>Reimplemented the Virtual Library application using
<link href="http://mckoi.com/database/">McKoi Database</link>, to be compatible with JBoss 2.4.3 (which no
longer includes InstantDB).
</p>

<source>
[ #506661 ] private asset configuration
[ #494456 ] StringValidator minLength message wrong
[ #488476 ] Generated URLs should contain entities.
[ #488432 ] Make duplicate page names illegal
[ #487394 ] NumericField doesn't work with long
[ #501750 ] StringValidator
[ #499057 ] BaseValidator summary typo
[ #487619 ] javadoc link errors
</source>


</section>

<section><title>Release 1.0.7</title>
				
<p>Removed Primix copyrights, as I no longer work there or do any work on their time.
</p>

<p>Consolidated and cleaned up many of the tutorials into the new Workbench.
</p>

<p>Improvements to Inspector's Properties Explorer.  It is now more tolerant of exceptions thrown while
accessing properties.
</p>

<p>Streamlined the distribution by removing the source for documentation.
</p>

<source>
[ #480433 ] StatementAssembly - access to JBDC 2.0
[ #469747 ] more flexible application parser
[ #484184 ] JavaDoc error
</source>
				
				</section><section><title>Release 1.0.6</title>
				
				<p>Tapestry now uses <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">Ant</link>
				as its build tool.  The GNU Makefile Java Build Environment has
				been removed.
				</p>

				<p>The Tapestry Inspector now has a powerful Properties Explorer which allows
				for dynamic navigation and display of an object's properties (similar
				to what a debugger provides).
				</p>

				<p>Localization of context assets was broken in Tomcat; it now works
				in both Tomcat and Jetty.
				</p>

				</section>
				
				<section><title>Release 1.0.5</title>
				
				<p>Added a mechanism to clear out pooled objects when they haven't been used
				for some time.  The interface <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/util/ICleanable.html">ICleanable</link>
				has the details.
				</p>

				<p>Made a number of other efficiency improvements.  Particularily, the page loader now weeds
				out informal parameters that can't be used (because they conflict with formal parameter names,
				or because the component owns the attributes), preventing them from being added as component
				bindings.  The old method was to weed out the unwanted parameters on every
				render, which was more expensive.
				</p>

				<p>Improved the <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/valid/NumericField.html">NumericField</link>
				component to deal with null values in an intelligent manner.
				</p>

				<p>It is now possible to set properties of
				<link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/doc/DevelopersGuide/components.helper-beans.html">helper beans</link>.
				</p>

				<p>The full distribution now bundles 
				<link href="http://jetty.mortbay.com">Jetty 3.1RC9</link>
				and the Virtual Library is now compatible with
				<link href="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss 2.4.0</link>.
				</p>
