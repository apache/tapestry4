  Tapestry is a quite comprehensive framework, but it gets a lot of support from other
  open-source frameworks.  The following libraries, in addition to the Tapestry libraries
  themselves, must be in the web application classpath (typically, by copying them into the
  WEB-INF/libs directory of the WAR file).
</p>

<p>
The Ant build script for Tapestry will automatically download dependencies.

<p>
Tapestry is expressly designed to be source compatible with <strong>JDK 1.3</strong> and <strong>Servlet API 2.2</strong>.  It does use a few features
of Servlet API 2.3 if available. 
</p>

<p>
  The <link href="tapestry-annotations/index.html">JDK 1.5 annotation support</link> does require JDK 1.5 to run.  The Workbench 
  example makes use of some of the annnotations, so it also requires JDK 1.5 to operate.
