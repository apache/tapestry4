Input Validation

  The tapestry validation system provides a very powerful means of validating data 
  intuitively on most of the form element components, such as {{{../components/TextField.html}TextField}}, 
  {{{../components/TextArea.html}TextArea}}, {{{../components/Checkbox.html}Checkbox}}, and so forth.  All of these 
  components implement the interface {{{../tapestry-framework/apidocs/org/apache/tapestry/form/IFormComponent.html}IFormComponent}}
  , and include the necessary hooks to fit into the overall validation framework.
  
  Localization, server-side, and client side validation are handled by the framework,
  as well as the ability to extend or override most of the built in functionality to
  suit your purposes as you see fit.
  
  Validation has evolved over time (the first attempt at proper validation using
  Tapestry occured back in 2001). Through Tapestry 3, validation was limited to the
  <<ValidField>> component (which is now deprecated). For Tapestry 4, the APIs related to 
  validation were effectively rewritten, resulting in a more powerful, more extensible approach
  that can be used with all kinds of form element components.
  
* FieldLabel component

  Generally speaking, every form input component ({{{../components/TextField.html}TextField}}, etc.) will 
  be paired with a {{{../components/FieldLabel.html}FieldLabel}} component. The FieldLabel is responsible 
  for generating the HTML \<label\> element, which is extremely effective for accessible user 
  interfaces (user interfaces that work for people with visual disabilities). Typical usage:
  
+------------------------------------------
&lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;label jwcid="@FieldLabel" field="component:userName"&gt;User Name&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;input jwcid="userName@TextField" value="ognl:userName" validators="validators:required" 
   displayName="User Name" size="30"/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
