        <section name="Tapestry Examples">
        <p>
            Tapestry's main distribution includes the Tapestry JAR files plus all source code for
            Tapestry, the Tapestry documentation, and Tapestry examples.
        </p>
        
        
        <span class="info">
            <strong>Note:</strong>
            <br />
            While the main source distribution does not require a 1.5 JDK, the examples do as they
            make use of features such as annotations.
        </span>
        
        <p>
            Because of licensing concerns, JAR dependencies (such as Javassist) and example
            applications are not distributed with Tapestry itself. As an Apache Software Foundation
            project, the Tapestry distributions
            <em>must</em>
            be limited to just software directly provided by the ASF; nothing from outside the ASF
            is allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you like, you can easily (?) build Tapestry, including the examples, from source. The
            necessary dependencies are automatically downloaded by Ant build scripts, but it takes
            some elbow grease to set up. Details at
            <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/tapestry/BuildingTapestry">the Wiki</a>
            .
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                But wouldn't it be nice to just get the compiled examples, ready to take for a spin?
            </strong>
            We think so, so we now provide the examples, precompiled, packaged, and ready to go, as
            a seperate distribution, from a non-ASF server.
        </p>
        <p>
            These examples are available at
            <a href="http://howardlewisship.com/downloads/quick-start/">
                http://howardlewisship.com/downloads/quick-start/
            </a>
            as
            <code>tapestry-examples-</code>
            <em>version</em>
            <code>.tar.gz</code>
            .
        </p>

        <p>
            The distribution is a snapshot of a
            <a href="http://jboss.org/">JBoss</a>
            4.0.2 instance, with two Tapestry applications deployed into it.
        </p>

        <p>
            To make use of it, unpack the distribution, which will create a
            <code>jboss-tapestry-examples-</code>
            <em>version</em>
            directory. Change to the
            <code>bin</code>
            sub-directory and execute the
            <code>run.bat</code>
            or
            <code>run.sh</code>
            startup script.
        </p>

        <p>JBoss will start up and you'll be able to access the two demonstration applications.</p>

            <p>
                The workbench is a testbed for many common Tapestry components. The tabs across the
                top demonstrate different Tapestry features and components, including localization,
                input validation, exception reporting, and the Palette and Table components.

            <p>
                The Virtual Library is a small but complete J2EE application. It uses J2EE Entity
                beans with container managed persistence, and a stateless session facade, with
                Tapestry on the front end. The application is used to manage a shared pool of books,
                tracking who owns and who is currently borrowing each book.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three users are built into the library. All three use the same password, "secret":
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>dilbert@bigco.com</li>
                <li>squeue@bug.org</li>
                <li>ringbearer@bagend.shire</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The "ringbearer" user has administrative access. When logged in as ringbearer,
                you'll see additional menu options for managing users and publishers.
