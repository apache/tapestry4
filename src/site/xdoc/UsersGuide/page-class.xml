<title>Determining the Page Class</title>
</properties>
<body>
<p>
  When it comes time for Tapestry to instantiate a page, it must identify the Java class
  to instantiate.
</p>

<p>
Tapestry pages implement the <a href="../tapestry-framework/apidocs/org/apache/tapestry/IPage.html">IPage</a> interface.  Because this is a large interface,
you will typically extends the <a href="../tapestry-framework/apidocs/org/apache/tapestry/html/BasePage.html">BasePage</a> base class (for HTML pages).
</p>

<p>
Typically, you will identify the page class within the page's specification, using
the <a href="spec.html#spec.page-specification">&lt;page-specification&gt;</a> element's class attribute.
</p>

<p>
In many cases, however, the page specification is optional.  Alternately, the class
attribute may be omitted from the page specification.  Tapestry takes the following steps
to find the class for a page:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>As indicated in the page specification</li>
  <li>By searching the packages listed in the application specification (more below)</li>
  <li>The application specification's org.apache.tapestry.default-page-class property</li>
  <li>The global property org.apache.tapestry.default-page-class</li>
</ul>

<p>
The most useful of these is the second option, to search.  For this step,
Tapestry looks in the application specification
for the org.apache.tapestry.page-class-packages <a href="spec.html#spec.meta">&lt;meta&gt;</a> property. This
is a comma-seperated list of package names to search.  The list of packages is
optional, and the default Java package is searched last.
</p>

<p>
Also, for this search, the page name is converted into a partial class name. For pages
inside folders, the folder names are part of the package name, so page name
<code>admin/EditUser</code> will be become <code>admin.EditUser</code>.
</p>

<p>
So, if the prefix list is <code>org.example.pages</code>, then Tapestry will search
for <code>org.example.pages.admin.EditUser</code>, then
<code>admin.EditUser</code> (that is, in the default package).
</p>

<p>
Only if those searches fail to locate a class  does Tapestry continue to the next steps, using
default page class names in the application specification and beyond.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>
<br/>
These steps are specified in the
<a href="../tapestry/hivedocs/config/tapestry.page.PageClassProviderChain.html">tapestry.page.PageClassProviderChain</a>
configuration point.
</p>

<p>
For simplicity, we described the search for application pages. For pages within a library, the process
is the same, but it is the library's specification which is searched for the list of packages,
and later, for the default page class name.
</p>

<section name="Component Classes">
  
  
<p>
A similar search occurs for components (again, with the express desire that the class attribute of the
<a href="spec.html#spec.component-specification">&lt;component-specification&gt;</a> <em>not</em> be used).  
</p>

<ul>
  <li>As defined by the component specification</li>
  <li>In any package defined by the containing namespace's org.apache.tapestry.component-class-packages
    meta data property (if any)</li>
  <li>In the default package</li>
  <li>
<a href="../tapestry-framework/apidocs/org/apache/tapestry/BaseComponent.html">BaseComponent</a> is the final default</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>
<br/>
These steps are specified in the
<a href="../tapestry/hivedocs/config/tapestry.page.ComponentClassProviderChain.html">tapestry.page.ComponentClassProviderChain</a>
configuration point.
