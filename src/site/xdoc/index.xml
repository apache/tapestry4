        <section name="Tapestry 4.1 - Dojo Integrated">
            <p>
                This development series is focused around providing a full layer of support for building
                highly dynamic web applications (XHR/ajax/dhtml).  Whether you would like to sprinkle in a
                few tiny ajax effects in an existing application, or build a full featured <em>heavy client</em> 
                type application Tapestry(and <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org">dojo</a>) should be able to 
                support your needs.

            </p>
            
            <p><strong>New Features:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>JSON -</b>  Brand new API enabling data communication 
                                   via the <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a>(JavaScript Object Notation) 
                                   standard. New component classes and rendering schemes also accompany 
                                   the API addition, allowing anyone to easily add JSON communication 
                                   to an existing component or new components. </li>
                <li><b>XHR -</b>  The ever popular XML communication format has also been added into the 
                                  Tapestry core, allowing most of the common <em>ajax</em> concepts to be
                                  easily developed in yours and existing Tapestry components.</li>
                <li><b><a href="http://dojotoolkit.org">Dojo</a> bundled -</b> As all of the functionality 
                                  in this release is based around the <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org">dojo</a>
                                   javascript toolkit, we have provided it bundled with the core Tapestry jar 
                                   files. No profile building/installation necessary. Just drop the jars in and
                                   get at all of the client side goodies you like.</li>
                <li><b>Widgets -</b> New <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org">dojo</a> toolkit based widget components
                                   and complimenting foundation Component classes make it easy for anyone to create
                                   dojo widgets and use them as Tapestry components. The initial 4.1 release won't be
                                   as focused on providing new components as it will solid infrastructure support, but
                                   more and more will be included as the release matures. Currently included are 
                                   <em>Autocomplete,DropdownDatePicker,DropdownTimePicker</em>.</li>
                <li><b>Client Side Validation -</b> The client side validation support in Tapestry has been completely
                                    replaced with a new <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org">dojo</a> based API, providing
                                    richer and more complete validation than has been seen in previous releases. All of the
                                    validation constraints that can be specified on the server now have client side functional
                                    equivalents. Default logic for displaying validation errors/interactions on the client side
                                    UI has also been updated a great deal. The old alert box mechanism has been replaced by field
                                    decorators that apply css rules to your form fields, as well as dhtml dialog boxes displaying
                                    summaries of errors. Much much more is planned in this area, but the current set of functionality
                                    should be more than enough to make many happy.</li>
                <li><b>New Annotations -</b> Perhaps the most exciting new addition, a new <strong>@EventListener</strong>
                                    annotation has been added. This will allow people to bind one of their page/component 
                                    class listeners to virtually any client side widget/html event concievable. The API also supports
                                    varying types of listening, such as being able to submit a form when a particular event happens, 
                                    or simplying using the new <b>BrowserEvent</b> object to determine the client side state when
                                    the event happened. <em>(Such as x/y coordinates of mouse clicks, event targets, etc..This is pretty
                                    much a literal one-to-one mapping to real browser generated Events.)</em></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Tapestry is an open-source framework for creating dynamic, robust, highly scalable
                web applications in Java. Tapestry complements and builds upon the standard Java
                Servlet API, and so it works in any servlet container or application server.

            <p>
                Most of the functionality in this series is based entirely on the wonderful 
                <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org">Dojo</a> javascript toolkit library. Not to 
                say that you won't easily be able to plug in another toolkit if you like, just 
                that the defaults will all be based around dojo.
