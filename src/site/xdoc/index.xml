            <p>
                This development series is focused around providing a full layer of support for building
                highly dynamic web applications(XHR/ajax/dhtml) using all of the resources that modern browsers allow. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tapestry is an open-source framework for creating dynamic, robust, highly scalable
                web applications in Java. Tapestry complements and builds upon the standard Java
                Servlet API, and so it works in any servlet container or application server.

        <section name="Dojo - The JavaScript Toolkit">
            <p>
                Most of the functionality in this series is based entirely on the wonderful <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org">Dojo</a>
                javascript toolkit library. Not to say that you won't easily be able to plug in another toolkit if
                you like, just that the defaults will all be based around dojo.
