                    Body:
                    <strong>allowed</strong>

                    Informal parameters:
                    <strong>forbidden</strong>

                <p>
                    When a
                    <a href="Block.html">Block</a>
                    component renders normally, it does absolutely nothing. It doesn't render any
                    tag, or render its body. However, a
                    <a href="RenderBlock.html">RenderBlock</a>
                    component can be passed a Block instance, which will trigger the Block to render
                    its body.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The parameters of the
                    <a href="RenderBlock.html">RenderBlock</a>
                    , including informal parameters, are indirectly available to the Block
                    component. The OGNL expression components.
                    <em>block</em>
                    .getParameter("
                    <em>name</em>
                    ") returns the value of a parameter bound to the
                    <a href="RenderBlock.html">RenderBlock</a>
                    which invoked the rendering of the Block's body.
