                The menu to the left lists all the components provided with the Tapestry framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                Such components may always be referenced without any library prefix; in cases where
                an application or library provides a component with the same name, the special
                prefix <code>framework:</code> may be used. That is, <code>DirectLink</code> and 
                <code>framework:DirectLink</code> are equivalent, unless your application 
                (or library) includes a component <em>also</em> named "DirectLink".
            </p>
