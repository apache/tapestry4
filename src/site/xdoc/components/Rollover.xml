        <section name="Rollover">

            <p>
                The Rollover component provides a rollover image button for use with any kind of
                link component. A rollover button image changes when the mouse move over it or off
                of it. A Rollover is disabled if the link that wraps it is disabled (in which case
                it doesn't respond to the mouse). If this dynamic behavior isn't required use the
                simpler
                <a href="Image.html">Image</a>
                component.
            </p>
            <p>
                The component provides all the necessary JavaScript to swap the image when the mouse
                enters and exits the button. However, the Rollover must be wrapped (ultimately) by a
                <a href="Body.html">Body</a>
                component.
            </p>
