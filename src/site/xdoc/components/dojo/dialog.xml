        <section name="Dialog">

            <p>
                Creates a modal Dialog on the client side (of sorts). This component may prove useful for cutting down
                on typical CRUD operations where you normally have to navigate to a lot of seperate pages to do things
                like "edit" / "view" / or "add" something. Why make your users navigate all over the place when they
                can do it right there? :)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also note that this particular component comes with two very useful methods that you can 
                invoke in java code to hide and show the Dialog. They are aptly named <code>hide()</code> and
                <code>show()</code>.

                            The html style color to give the background of the dialog. The color given can be a literal

                            Controls how opaque the background is. This parameter is given in the form of a percent, so
                            valid values would range from <code>0.1 - 1</code>.
