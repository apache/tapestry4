        <section name="Delegator">

            <p>
                A component which delegates its behavior (that is, the HTML rendered) to some other
                object.
                <br />
                This is occasionally useful when the HTML to render is best generated from pure Java
                code (or has been provided from some source outside of Tapestry).
