        <h4><a href="http://files.doublenegative.com.au/jumpstart/">Tapestry JumpStart</a></h4>
        <p>
            The <a href="http://files.doublenegative.com.au/jumpstart/">Tapestry JumpStart</a> project provides
            a fully functional example application demonstrating some commonly used/needed functionality in
            typical Tapestry applications.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A login screen with basic authentication.</li>
            <li>These pre-built tables and entities: Users, Roles, Codes and CodeGroups.</li>
            <li>Screens to search, create, edit, and delete them.</li>
            <li>All the source.</li>
            <li><strong>The Back button.</strong> JumpStart uses a flow synchronizer to handle the re-posting problems 
                caused by the Back button, Refresh button, and double-clicking on Submit buttons.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigating back.</strong> JumpStart implements a callback stack to answer 
                the question "where did I come from".</li>
            <li><strong>Date handling.</strong> JumpStart uses the joda-time classes, and provides validators, 
                translators, and a date picker for them.</li>
            <li><strong>Localization.</strong> JumpStart illustrates Tapestry's localization mechanism in action.</li>
            <li><strong>Client Persistence.</strong> JumpStart implements the "client:form"  strategy.</li>
            <li><strong>Business and data layer.</strong> JumpStart uses <b>EJB3</b>, without the need for value objects/DTOs.</li>
        </ul>
