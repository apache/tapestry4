      <motion> I think its pretty obvious by now that no work is going to get done on the Tutorial for 3.0. I think it would be best to remove the Tutorial, perhaps replace it with a link to Kevin Dorff's site until we can actually put something useful together ... even if that is after 3.0 is released. A +1 vote would delete the Tutorial code, the docbook source and links to the old tutorial on the web site. </motion>

Tsvetelin has more than an year and a half of Tapestry experience, has worked with many large web projects, and can be very helpful overall for the development of the framework, especially in the area of dynamic pages with layout determined at runtime.

      <motion> We informally discussed this not too long ago; I think we are at a good point for beta-2. There have been some significant improvements since beta-1a that will largely be invisible to most users (the correct thing for a beta release); at the same time, I think we're all anxious to push forward and get Tapestry 3.0-xxx into wider distribution. Although there are still several outstanding bugs (one or two that are problematic) I think this is a good time to keep momentum going and 
        release the next beta. A +1 vote will procede with beta-2, tagging the repository and pushing the new releases out to the Apache distribution mirrors. </motion>
