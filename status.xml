      <motion>Although it hasn't been long since alpha-2, I'd like to release the next alpha of Tapestry 4.0. Why? A few things have settled down, some bugs have been fixed, a few really key features have been added, and I think the Portlet support is now complete.</motion>

      <motion> Now that HiveMind 1.1 has entered beta, I believe it's time to release a new alpha of Tapestry 4.0 (Picasso). This will give people a chance to see more of the (incomplete) Portlet support and many of the other recent fixes and improvements. </motion>

    <vote title="Tapestry 4.0" date="Apr 15 2005" dev="HLS">
      <motion>The sentiment of the community seems to be that the next major release of Tapestry (i.e., HiveMind infrastructure, Portlet support, etc.) is too different from Tapestry 3.0 to be called "Tapestry 3.1". This release will only be largely backwards compatible; applications that sub-class BaseEngine or make use of custom Tapestry engine services will require some amount of re-work. In a small number of cases, component parameters (espcially those using direction "auto" or "custom") 
        will not work exactly as before. I feel it is completely reasonable to not call this release 3.1, but to continue to bend over backwards for backwards compatibility. A +1 vote signals that you concur, and that the next release should be numbered 4.0. This will affect the code in a very limited way: Much code has been added with a @since 3.1 javadoc tag; this will change to @since 4.,0. Likewise, the 3.1 numbering is in documentation, and inside some of the specification DTDs; these will 
        also change. </motion>

      <motion>I think it's high time we provide people with a peek at 3.1. The code base has stabilized quite a bit in the last week or two, and although there's a huge amount of work to come, I think the community would benefit from an easy preview of what's coming. This will also be a chance to work through the release checklist I prepared last week.</motion>

      <motion> I think its pretty obvious by now that no work is going to get done on the Tutorial for 3.0. I think it would be best to remove the Tutorial, perhaps replace it with a link to Kevin Dorff's site until we can actually put something useful together ... even if that is after 3.0 is released. A +1 vote would delete the Tutorial code, the docbook source and links to the old tutorial on the web site. </motion>

      <motion> We informally discussed this not too long ago; I think we are at a good point for beta-2. There have been some significant improvements since beta-1a that will largely be invisible to most users (the correct thing for a beta release); at the same time, I think we're all anxious to push forward and get Tapestry 3.0-xxx into wider distribution. Although there are still several outstanding bugs (one or two that are problematic) I think this is a good time to keep momentum going and 
        release the next beta. A +1 vote will procede with beta-2, tagging the repository and pushing the new releases out to the Apache distribution mirrors. </motion>
