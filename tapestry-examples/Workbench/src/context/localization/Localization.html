<h2>Localization / i10n</h2>

<p>
This page allows the locale to be changed.  Localization is used to select
the HTML template used by the page (and any components on the page).  Likewise,
assets, such as the change button, may also be localized and automatically
selected.

Select a new locale:

<form jwcid="form">
