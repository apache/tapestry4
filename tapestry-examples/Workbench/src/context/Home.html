<h2>Tapestry Workbench</h2>

<p>This is the Tapestry Workbench.  It is a testing ground for Tapestry.
Each tab above links to a new page, or set of pages, that demonstrate Tapestry components and
features.</p>

<p>The check box control below is used to enable or disable the display of request information.  This is
a detailed description of incoming request and session data, the same as provided by
the Tapestry Inspector.  This is very useful when trying to understand or debug a form component.</p>

<p>The Tapestry icon in the lower right corner raises the Tapestry Inspector in a new window.
The Inspector is a mini-application used
to explore a running Tapestry application.</p>
