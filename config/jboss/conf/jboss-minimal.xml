    <!-- The URLComparator can be used to specify a deployment ordering
         for deployments found in a scanned directory.  The class specified
         must be an implementation of java.util.Comparator, it must be able
         to compare two URL objects, and it must have a no-arg constructor.
         Two deployment comparators are shipped with JBoss:
           - org.jboss.deployment.DeploymentSorter 
             Sorts by file extension, as follows:
               "sar", "service.xml", "rar", "jar", "war", "wsr", "ear", "zip", 
               "*"
           - org.jboss.deployment.scanner.PrefixDeploymentSorter
             If the name portion of the url begins with 1 or more digits, those 
             digits are converted to an int (ignoring leading zeroes), and 
             files are deployed in that order.  Files that do not start with 
             any digits will be deployed last, and they will be sorted by
             extension as above with DeploymentSorter.
