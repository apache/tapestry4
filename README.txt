Thanks for downloading Tapestry!

The main Tapestry distribution includes pre-compiled JAR files:
  - tapestry-x.x.jar                the main Tapestry framework
  - tapestry-contrib-x-x.jar        additional contributed components
  - tapestry-annotations-x-x.jar    JDK 1.5 annotation support
  - tapestry-portlet-x-x.jar		JSR-168 Portlet support

In addition, the main distribution includes all the source code and build scripts 
for Tapestry as well as a few example applications.
  
Documentation for Tapestry is a seperate download, available at
http://jakarta.apache.org/site/downloads/downloads_tapestry.cgi

The documentation includes everything available on the Tapestry home page, at 
http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/

Tapestry now includes a getting-started guide; see
http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/QuickStart/index.html
  
Tapestry has a number of additional runtime dependencies which must be downloaded
and packaged with the above JARS in the WEB-INF/lib folder of Tapestry web
applications.

The Ant build scripts for Tapestry will automatically download these dependencies.  The 
build scripts require some configuration to work; details are available at 
http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-tapestry/BuildingTapestry

Alternately, you may download the dependencies individually.  Details at
http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/dependencies.html
