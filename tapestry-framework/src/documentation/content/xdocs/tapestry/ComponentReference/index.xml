    <body>
        <p> The menu to the left lists all the components provided with the Tapestry framework. </p>
        <p> Such components may always be referenced without any library prefix; in cases where an application or
            library provides a component with the same name, the special prefix "framework:" may be used. That is,
            "DirectLink" and "framework:DirectLink" are equivalent, unless your application (or library) includes a
            component <em>also</em> named "DirectLink". </p>
