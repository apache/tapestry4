</div>Tapestry is an alternative to 
	scripting environments such as
      JavaServer Pages or Velocity.  Tapestry goes far further,
   		providing a complete framework for
   		creating extremely dynamic applications
   		with minimal amounts of coding.
      
      
      <p>Tapestry's approach, using a
      component object model similar to a
      traditional GUI, provides 
      the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Very high level of reuse, within and between projects<br>
				<i>Everything in Tapestry is a reusable component</i>
				
				<li>Frees developers from writing boring, buggy code<br>
				<i>Code in terms of objects, methods&nbsp;and properties, not URLs and query parameters</i>
				
				<li>Allows applications' complexity&nbsp;to scale well<br>
				<i>Framework does all the URL building and message dispatching, transparently</i>
				
				<li>Easy Internationalization/Localization<br>
				<i>Framework selects localized version of text, templates and images</i>
				
				<li>Extremely robust applications<br>
				<i>Less code is less bugs; 
        plus sophisticated built-in exception reporting and other
				developer tools built in</i>
				
				<li>Easy team integration<br>
				<i>Graphic designers and Java developers
				can work together without having
				to know each other's jobs</i></li>
			</ul>

<p>Tapestry exploits the dynamic nature of the Java language, leveraging the JavaBeans API, as well
    as servlets and other J2EE technology.  Tapestry applications are fast, scalable, robust and powerful.
<p>Tapestry components are a combination of a 
      specification file (in XML), an HTML template and a Java class
      (extending a framework class, with simple additions). Tapestry components 
      are combined together to form larger components or complete Tapestry 
pages.
<p>The Tapestry project began in January, 2000.
      It was released onto <a target="_top" href="http://sf.net/projects/tapestry">SourceForge</a> in July, 2000.
	  Release 1.0.0 
      occured in May, 2001 and Release 2.0.0 in April, 2002.</p>
<p>Tapestry has been described in the print journal 
	  <b>The Java Report</b> in the September 2001 issue.  Other articles
	  includes the on-line journal <a target="_top" href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2001/11/21/tapestry.html">OnJava</a>, in November 2001.

<p>
Tapestry has a very active <a target="_top" href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tapestry-developer">Developer Mailing List</a>
(with complete <a target="_top" href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=7644">archives</a>).  
<p>
A <A href="wiki_frame.html" target=_top>Wiki</a> has been set 
      up to discuss Tapestry and plan new features.</p>
