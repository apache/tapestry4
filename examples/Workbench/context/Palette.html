<p>The Palette component is used to collect multiple selections, items are selected
in the left column (available) and moved to the right column (selected).  The component
can be configured to keep the items sorted by their visible label, their
hidden value, or manually sorted.  Items are moved between columns using the buttons,
or by double clicking.

<form jwcid="@Form" listener="ognl:listeners.formSubmit">

<table class="form">
	<tr>
		<th>Sort Mode:</th>
		<td><input jwcid="inputColorSort"/></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Colors:</th>
		<td><input jwcid="inputColor"/></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td><input jwcid="update"/>
			<input jwcid="continue"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>

</form>

<p>
Obviously, there's a whole lot of JavaScript running on the client side.  However, there
are no arbitrary limits; you can have as many Palettes in a form as you want, or have multiple
forms and multiple Palettes.  Tapestry uses a sophisticated method of generating custom JavaScript
from a template.

<p>You can also customize the images used for the buttons and the titles above the
two selection columns.
