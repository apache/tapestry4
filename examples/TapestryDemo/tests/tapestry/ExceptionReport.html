<p>Tapestry exception reporting is very powerful.  It uses some reflection magic to break apart
the exception into properties, and to dig down into nested exceptions when the properties
are themselves exceptions.  Other magic breaks apart the stack trace into individual lines
for better presentation (using &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt;).

<p>Of course, your application should never have an uncaught exception at deployment, right?

<p>As you can see, you may also customize the look and feel of the page that generates the exception display.

<p>More advanced solutions would store all this information on the server (in a file or database) and give
the user just a hint of it, with some kind of guru code to provide to customer service.  Or something.
