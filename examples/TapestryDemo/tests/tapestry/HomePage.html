<h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>Tapestry is all about components:  Components to represent pages, components on those pages, components
within those components.  What you are looking at now looks like a seamless HTML page
but is actually brought to you via a network of related Tapestry components.

<p>In Tapestry, you combine components together to form
pages.  Components have a specification, a Java class and an HTML template.

<p>The Show Inspector component (on the left) 
launches the Tapestry Inspector window, which allows you to explore the component hierarchy
on a page.  It's on every page (you'll notice it is contained within the border component and every
page in the demo application is wrapped by the border component).

<h3>Things to Check Out</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Inspector ... it really shows off how Tapestry uses components
<li>The Debug page to see how Tapestry will help you debug your applications
<li><a href="#exceptions">Exception handling</a> ... see how Tapestry supports you in a worst case
scenario!
</ul> 

<h3>Basic Stuff</h3>

	<p>A demonstration of stateful actions.  The list below is provided by the
	page, and a Foreach is used to walk through the values.  Note that Tapestry takes care of
	creating and responding to the URLs, and this same template and set of components continues 
	to work, even if the names or number of elements changes.  The home page's Java class
	provides the list of selections as a JavaBeans property.
	
	<p>The current selection is:
	<span class="current-selection">
	<jwc id="insertActiveSelection"/></span>

	<p>Change it to:
		<ul>
		<jwc id="e">
			<li><jwc id="changeSelection"><jwc id="insertCurrentSelection"/></jwc>
		</jwc>
</ul>

<h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3>

Exception handling in Tapestry is very robust.  If something goes truly wrong, you see a lot of information.

<p>The following links throw exceptions, so you can see the information that Tapestry provides when
an unexpected exception is thrown.

<ul>
<li><jwc id="invalidPageLink">PageLink to unknown page</jwc>
<li><jwc id="classCastLink">ActionLink with invalid listener</jwc>
<li><jwc id="badSpecification">Page with invalid specification</jwc>
<li><jwc id="badTemplate">Page with invalid template</jwc>
</ul>

<hr>

Restart session discards the HttpSession object and creates a new one, then redirects to the home page. 
Useful after a thrown exception leaves the application in a confused state.

<p>Reset server discards all cached information about specifications and HTML templates then restarts the session.
This is pretty much the same as bouncing the server.
