<p>A skunkworks project by <b>Howard Ship</b>.

<p>The above image is a private asset that lives inside the classpath and is not normally
visible to the web server.  The <code>AssetService</code> is responsible for either allowing
access to it, or copying the file from inside the classpath to some location in the web server's
hierarchy.  The former works well during development, the latter is better during production (when possible,
for performance reasons).

<p>Check out this rollover button.  It really takes 'blur' (i.e, mouse out) to a new level!

<div align=center>
<jwc id="homeLink"><jwc id="homeButton"/></jwc>
</div>

<p>All that is taken care of with a single <b>Rollover</b> component, wrapped by
an <b>Service</b> component (a type of service link, it generates the &lt;a&gt; tag).
