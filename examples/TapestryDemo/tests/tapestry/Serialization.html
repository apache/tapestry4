<p>This page shows how the application and each page recorder is serialized, both compressed and
uncompressed.
<ul>
	<li><a href="#application">application</a>
	<jwc id="e-toc">
		<li><a href="#<jwc id="insertPageName1"/>"><jwc id="insertPageName2"/></a>
	</jwc>
</ul>

<p>In clustering environments, this is critical, since the contents of the HttpSession
are constantly being serialized and distributed around the cluster.  
Under Tapestry, the only object in the HttpSession is the Application object, but it can't
get very large, especially if it's a SimpleApplication, which stores all the page recorders
as Maps, in memory (more sophisticated application's will store this data in a database).

<p>This page allows me to guage how out-of-control large my HttpSession is going to be; I may yet put some 
actual compression into SimpleApplication.
