    <title>Tapestry Contrib Library</title>
	</header>
	
  <body>
    <p>A collection of powerful add-on components for Tapestry.</p>
    <p>This library started as a collection of components <em>contrib</em>uted by the community.</p>
    
    <p>
      To make use of this library, you must include its JAR on the classpath (typically, by copying it into WEB-INF/lib), and
      extend your application specification, and add a &lt;library&gt; element:
    </p>
    
<source><![CDATA[
 <library id="contrib" specification-path="classpath:/org/apache/tapestry/contrib/Contrib.library"/>
]]></source>    

  <p>
    You may then reference the components of the framework using the prefix:
  </p>
  
<source><![CDATA[
  <table jwcid="@contrib:Table" ...> ... 
]]></source>
    
<p>
The prefix "contrib:" can be changed; if you don't like typing, make it "c:" ... Tapestry doesn't care!
</p>
    
  </body>
