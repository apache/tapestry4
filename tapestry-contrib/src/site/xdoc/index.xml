        <section name="Tapestry Contrib Library">

            <p>A collection of powerful add-on components for Tapestry.</p>
            <p>
                This library started as a collection of components
                <em>contrib</em>
                uted by the community.
            </p>

            <p>
                To make use of this library, you must include its JAR on the classpath (typically,
                by copying it into WEB-INF/lib), and extend your application specification, and add
                a &lt;library&gt; element:
            </p>

            <source xml:space="preserve">
 &lt;library id="contrib" specification-path="classpath:/org/apache/tapestry/contrib/Contrib.library"/&gt;
</source>

            <p>You may then reference the components of the framework using the prefix:</p>

            <source xml:space="preserve">
  &lt;table jwcid="@contrib:Table" ...&gt; ... 
</source>

            <p>
                The prefix "contrib:" can be changed; if you don't like typing, make it "c:" ...
                Tapestry doesn't care!
            </p>
