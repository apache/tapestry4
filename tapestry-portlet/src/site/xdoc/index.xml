        <section name="Tapestry Portlet Support">

            <p>
                An add-on module for Tapestry that enables the use of Tapestry to create
                <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168">JSR-168 Portlets</a>
                . Portlet support is new in Tapestry 4.0. To a large degree, Tapestry has been
                re-architected to support portlets.
            </p>

            <p>
                Portlet support in Tapestry is
                <em>native</em>
                . This means that Tapestry is, under the covers, using the true Portlet API as it is
                intended to be used. Some portal services support bridging ... allowing servlet
                applications to operate as portlet applications unchanged; such an approach is
                possible as well, but is not necessary.
            </p>

            <p>
                The pattern of development for Tapestry portlet applications is to create a
                (generally) small application, consisting of just a few pages. Each Tapestry portlet
                within a portal page will be a completely separate instance of not just the portlet,
                but all the Tapestry services behind it.
            </p>
